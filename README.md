This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Database (Drizzle ORM)

This project uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) with PostgreSQL. The schema lives in `src/lib/schema.ts` and the database connection in `src/lib/db.ts`.

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run db:push` | Directly syncs your schema to the database without generating migration files. Good for development. |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generates SQL migration files in the `drizzle/` folder based on schema changes. |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Applies any pending migration files from `drizzle/` to the database. |
| `npm run db:studio` | Opens Drizzle Studio — a browser-based UI to browse and edit your database. |
| `npm run seed` | Seeds the `users_simple` table with sample data (reads `DATABASE_URL` from `.env.local`). |
